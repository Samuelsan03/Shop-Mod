# Shop-Mod-Survivalcraft 2
An old Survivalcraft 2 community mod where you can purchase items during your survival, whether cruel or harmless. If you can't get rare items, you can buy them there, but you'll need to level up to level 11. You can sell items from the collected items. As a note, the mod was originally in Mandarin, but I translated it for September 2025, so you won't have any trouble understanding the original language.
